# Ultra-Fast Force Fields (UF<sup>3</sup>): Ne-Xe Example

## Dataset

The included LAMMPS run is a short simulation of a Ne-Xe mixture (64 atoms). The simulation consists of two rapid heating/cooling cycles at constant volume.

The resulting molecular dynamics snapshots, taken 1 ps apart, include a wide range of atomic environments.
