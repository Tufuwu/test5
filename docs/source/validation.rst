Validation
==========

Interpreting EIS data fundamentally relies on the the system conforming to
conditions of causality, linearity, and stability. For an example of how
the adherence to the Kramers-Kronig relations, see the `Validation Example Jupyter Notebook
<examples/validation_example.ipynb>`_

Lin-KK method
-------------

Validating your data with the lin-KK model requires fitting an optimal number
of RC-elements and analysis of the residual errors.
