What method does impedance.py use for fitting equivalent circuit models?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, fitting is performed by non-linear least squares regression of
the circuit model to impedance data via
`curve_fit <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html>`_
from the `scipy.optimize` package.[1]
Real and imaginary components are fit simultaneously with uniform
weighting, i.e. the objective function to minimize is,

.. math::
    \chi^2 = \sum_{n=0}^{N} [Z^\prime_{data}(\omega_n) - Z^\prime_{model}(\omega_n)]^2 +
                   [Z^{\prime\prime}_{data}(\omega_n) - Z^{\prime\prime}_{model}(\omega_n)]^2

where N is the number of frequencies and :math:`Z^\prime` and
:math:`Z^{\prime\prime}` are the real and imaginary components of
the impedance, respectively.
The default optimization method is the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (:code:`method='lm'`) for unconstrained
problems and the Trust Region Reflective algorithm
(:code:`method='trf'`) if bounds are provided. See `the SciPy documentation
<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html>`_
for more details and options.

While the default method converges quickly and often yields acceptable fits,
the results may be sensitive to the initial conditions.
EIS fitting can be prone to this issue given the high dimensionality
of typical equivalent circuit models.
`Global optimization algorithms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_optimization>`_
attempt to search the entire parameter landscape to minimize the error.
By setting :code:`global_opt=True` in :code:`circuit_fit`, :code:`impedance.py` will use the
`basinhopping <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.basinhopping.html>`_
global optimization algorithm (also from the `scipy.optimize` package[1]) instead of :code:`curve_fit`.
Note that the computational time may increase.
