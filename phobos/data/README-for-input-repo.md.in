# $INPUTNAME
This repo contains the $INPUTNAME model that is used to derive other models for the pipeline.

For each derived model there has to be a configuration file. This file has to be named like the derived model.
All configuration file must be listed in the `pipeline.yml`.
Moreover, all repositories must be listed in the `manifest.xml`. Those are stored in the model_definitions repo.

## How to update?
Simply replace the here in given model with your new model. And have an eye on the CI pipeline to see if everything runs as with the old model.
