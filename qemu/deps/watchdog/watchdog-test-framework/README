This is a simple framework for testing the qemu watchdog virtual
device.  It's easier to use this framework than running the whole
watchdog daemon.

Instructions for use:

(1) Compile this program.  It creates a statically linked Linux binary
called 'watchdog-test'.

(2) You will need an existing Linux guest.

(3) Change the configuration of the Linux guest to add a watchdog
device.

If using libvirt, add a clause in the <devices> section:

    <watchdog model='i6300esb' action='poweroff' />

If using qemu directly, use the following command line options:

  qemu-kvm ... -watchdog i6300esb -watchdog-action poweroff

model can be either 'i6300esb' or 'ib700'.

action can be: 'reset', 'shutdown', 'poweroff', 'pause',
'none' or 'dump'

(4) Install the statically linked watchdog-test binary in the Linux
guest.

(5) Boot up the guest.  Log into the guest.

(6) [ib700 only] You have to load the ib700wdt kernel module manually
since it's an ISA device:

  sudo modprobe ib700wdt

(7) Run the watchdog-test binary (as root), and follow instructions.
