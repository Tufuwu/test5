<p>The CERN Library Catalogue includes all the collections available at the CERN Library. It includes more than 115,000 books, 23,000 conference proceedings, almost 14,000 standards and some 2400 journal titles. Most of those documents are available in electronic format.</p>
<p>In order to access those documents, you can search within the catalogue, and either access the document online or borrow the physical copy from the Library. If you do not want to come to the Library, you can request the document online, and we'll send it to you by internal mail.</p>
<p>If you do not find what you are looking for or would like to purchase a document, do not hesitate to request the document you need via this <a href="/request">form</a> or <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
