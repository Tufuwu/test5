Should be expression only
FILTER [string]

http://mapserver.org/mapfile/label.html
PRIORITY [integer]|[item_name]|[attribute]
What is item_name? Same as attribute?
[Attribute] was introduced in version 5.6 to specfify the font alias.

MAXSIZE is double. In label it is int. Probably ok

FILTER should also have expression as an option

For expressions, is this valid?

EXPRESSION (true)
