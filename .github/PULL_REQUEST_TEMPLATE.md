  * Unless otherwise necessary, you have only commit.
  * If new features or code has been added, proper tests for the new
functionality are included.
  * Additional code or changes to the existing code are properly documented
in the `docs/` directory when appropriate.
3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a PR.

  * Provide a description of your changes.
  * Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close any issue(s) your PR
