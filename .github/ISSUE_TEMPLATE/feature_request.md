<!--Please note that this template is only meant to be a guideline, feel free to use your own feature request structure: as long as it's clear what you'd like to see improved and why, the format doesn't matter -->

**What would you like to see added/improved?**
Let us know what's missing, awkward, poorly documented, or otherwise in need of improvement in PySDL2, and how you think it should be fixed!

**Why would this change be useful?**
If requesting a new feature or a change to existing behavior, please explain how the change/improvement would be useful for your PySDL2 projects.

(The better we understand the use case for a new feature, the better we can prioritize its addition and figure out a good implementation).

**Are you willing to try making these changes yourself in a PR?**
Yes / No (No worries if you're not, but contributors are always appreciated!)

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots relevant to the request here.
