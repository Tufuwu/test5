**New features:**

 * Development and reviewing contributors fields for Git items\
   New information about the participants during the development and the
   reviewing processes are available in `Git` items. The Git backend
   extracts these data from `Approved-by`, `Co-authored-by`,  and
   `Merged-by` trailers that some commit messages might include. For each
   one of these trailers, new fields will be available with the suffixes:
   `_bots`, `_domains`, `_names`, `_org_names`, and `_uuids`. Also for
   each one of these suffixes, there will be extra fields with the prefix
   `non_authored_`. This is an example of the fields available for the
   the trailer `Merged-by`:     - merged_by_multi_bots     -
   merged_by_multi_domains     - merged_by_multi_names     -
   merged_by_multi_org_names     - merged_by_multi_uuids     -
   non_authored_merged_by_multi_bots     -
   non_authored_merged_by_multi_domains     -
   non_authored_merged_by_multi_names     -
   non_authored_merged_by_multi_org_names
 * Option 'to-date' on the backend sections\
   The option `to-date` on the `setup.cfg` allows fetching data until a
   specific date. By default, this value is `2100-01-01`.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Onion study on Github pull requests fixed\
   Github pull requests onion study is now updated to allow passing the
   study alias name by parameter.
 * Onion study on Gitlab fixed\
   Gitlab onion study is now updated to allow passing the study alias
   name by parameter.

**Dependencies updateds:**
