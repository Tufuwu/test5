**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix typo in SortingHat fields\
   Some fields were not updated from the old version of SortingHat. Now
   the API returns 'isBot' and 'genderAcc' instead of 'is_bot' and
   'gender_acc'.

**Breaking changes:**

 * Define date format for Git documents\
   Git by default uses a custom date format that is not recognized by
   Elastic/OpenSearch.  Specify the format for the AuthorDate and
   CommitDate fields in Git documents to support the formats usually
   returned by `git log`.  This allows us to do proper filtering on these
   fields such as "all documents with CommitDate before 2020".
 * Update support for ES/OS versions > 7.X/1.X\
   Currently the support for ES/OS versions > 7.X/1.X is broken due to a
   faulty version check.  Add a static method to the Elasticsearch object
   that correctly checks whether the version is 'legacy' (defined as ES
   6.X or OS 0.X) and adds this check to various places in the codebase.
   Additionally, fixes an instance where `interval` is used instead of
   `fixed_interval`. `interval` was deprecated in ES7.
