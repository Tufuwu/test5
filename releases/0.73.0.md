## GrimoireELK 0.73.0 - (2020-06-13)

**New features:**

 * Add support for Launchpad (#842)\
   Added support for creating raw and enriched indexes of launchpad bugs.
   The schemas and tests for data have also been added.
 * Support for Git private repos (#873)\
   Git private repos can now be handled by  ELK, which allows to deal
   with the credentials that appear in the repo URLs passed via the
   projects.json. These URLs are processed when storing/retrieving the
   data in the raw, enriched and studies indexes to make  sure that the
   credentials are not included in the indexes nor visible on the
   dashboards.
 * Sync AOC and Git raw indexes (#884)\
   Git commits can be deleted over time from the original repo (e.g.,
   deleting working/test branches). Currently, this information is
   propagated to the raw and enriched indexes, but not the AOC  index.
   This new feature allows to sync the Git raw data with  the AOC one.
