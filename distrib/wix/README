This directory contains the files needed to build a Windows installer (MSI)
for bakefile.

Notice that the installer is very much experimental and work in progress.

To use it you need to install WiX (http://wixtoolset.org/).
Version 3.5 or later must be used (because of "MajorUpgrade" use), 3.5.2519.0
was used for testing.

Run "make -C distrib distrib_msi" and the output file will be
bakefile-X.Y.Z_beta-bin.msi.

Then you can do:

	msiexec /i distrib/bakefile-*.msi

to test installation.
